This is my portfolio website created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This site is designed to showcase the projects I've worked on throughout the years and give summaries and screenshots of what my projects do.
All the code for these projects can be found on my github and each project page will have a link to the github repo for the project.

[Live site can be found here](https://portfolio-site-tomyyyd.vercel.app/0.
